  PhD student in Machine Learning at [Mila](https://mila.quebec), with [Prof Jian Tang](https://www.jian-tang.com). I am broadly interested in how learning can be improved through the use of graph representations, having previously worked on algorithmic alignment for implicit planning and applications to biotechnology (drug discovery and drug combinations).

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
