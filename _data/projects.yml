    Graph Representation Learning and Beyond Workshop at ICML 2020
  description: |
    We propose a GNN-executor aimed at modelling the value iteration (VI) algorithm, across arbitrary environment models, with direct supervision on the intermediate steps of VI.

    Machine Learning for Molecules Workshop at NeurIPS 2020 
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraph
    We introduce a multi-view framework for drug combinations which leverages information from the drugs’ chemical structure, while also matching the sets of the drugs' target proteins.

  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    We propose a neural network architecture able to set state-of-the-art results on the drug-drug interaction (DDI) task---using the type of the side-effect and the molecular structure of the drugs alone---by leveraging a co-attentional mechanism.
